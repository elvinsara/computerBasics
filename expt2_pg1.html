        <p style="font-size: 20px;">In order to make websites look and function a certain way, web developers utilize different languages. The three core languages that make up the World Wide Web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            In the IT world, the internet is an essential platform, whether its for developing or for consumer use. When developing a website, typically three main languages come into play. These languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. HTML is the backbone of most webpages. Essentially, it is used to create the structure of how a specific website would look like, from the headings, to the paragraphs, the body, links, and even images.</p>
        <br>
        <a name ="Markup Languages"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Markup Languages</h2>
        <hr>   
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Markup languages are the languages in which the web is written. The most common markup language used is HTML, which uses tags to annotate text so that a computer can then manipulate the text. Most markup languages are human readable, and use annotations that are distinguishable from the annotated text. There are many different kinds of markups and languages, but all are consistent in the way in which they annotate documents.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">One extremely important characteristic of most markup languages is that they allow mixing markup directly into text streams. This happens all the time in documents: A few words in a sentence must be emphasized, or identified as a proper name, defined term, or other special item. This is quite different structurally from traditional databases, where it is by definition impossible to have data that is (for example) within a record, but not within any field. Likewise, markup for natural language texts must maintain ordering: it would not suffice to make each paragraph of a book into a "paragraph" record, where those records do not maintain order.</p>
        <h2 style="color: saddlebrown;">Types of Markup Languages</h2>
        <p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Presentational Markup</b></p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">The kind of markup used by traditional word-processing systems: binary codes embedded within document text that produce the WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") effect. Such markup is usually hidden from the human users, even authors and editors. Properly speaking, such systems use procedural and/or descriptive markup underneath, but convert it to "present" to the user as geometric arrangements of type.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Procedural Markup</b></p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Markup is embedded in text which provides instructions for programs to process the text. Well-known examples include troff, TeX, and PostScript. It is expected that the processor will run through the text from beginning to end, following the instructions as encountered. Text with such markup is often edited with the markup visible and directly manipulated by the author. Popular procedural markup systems usually include programming constructs, and macros or subroutines are commonly defined so that complex sets of instructions can be invoked by a simple name (and perhaps a few parameters). This is much faster, less error-prone, and maintenance-friendly than re-stating the same or similar instructions in many places.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Descriptive Markup</b></p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Markup is specifically used to label parts of the document for what they are, rather than how they should be processed. Well-known systems that provide many such labels include LaTeX, HTML, and XML. The objective is to decouple the structure of the document from any particular treatment or rendition of it. Such markup is often described as "semantic". An example of a descriptive markup would be HTML's <cite> tag, which is used to label a citation. Descriptive markup — sometimes called logical markup or conceptual markup — encourages authors to write in a way that describes the material conceptually, rather than visually.[9</p>

        <a name = "Hypertext"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Hypertext</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Hypertext is defined as the arrangement of information inside a database that allows the user to receive information and to navigate from one document to another by clicking on highlighted words or pictures inside the primary document. Hypertext is the base of the World Wide Web, because it enables user to click on other links to get more information. Hypertext is a term used for all links, whether it appears as texts or other graphical part.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">Hypertext documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as dynamic web pages). Static hypertext can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, software applications, or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines. Links used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document. A lesser known feature is StretchText, which expands or contracts the content in place, thereby giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document. Some implementations support transclusion, where text or other content is included by reference and automatically rendered in place.
            Hypertext can be used to support very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hypertext is the World Wide Web, written in the final months of 1990 and released on the Internet in 1991.

        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">HTML is the conventional markup language used to create and edit web pages and web applications. HTML is used for creating the basic structure of a website. HTML consists of different elements preceded by an opening tag, <tag>, and a closing tag, </tag>. The content between the tags, <html> and </html>, is the content of the webpage. The content between the tags, <head> and </head>, is the title of the webpage. This text is displayed between the <title> and </title> tags. The content between the tags, <body> and </body>, is the main content of the webpage. The content can include links , paragraphs, headings, and various other elements.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>

        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style = "font-size: 20px;">HTTP is the protocol used by the World Wide Web that determines how messages are formatted and transmitted. It also directs web servers and browsers to what actions they should take in reaction to several commands. When you open your web browser and enter a URL, you are using HTTP. The Web server directs it to get and transmit the requested Web page based on the HTTP command that is sent.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">An HTTP session is a sequence of network request–response transactions. An HTTP client initiates a request by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to a particular port on a server (typically port 80, occasionally port 8080; see List of TCP and UDP port numbers). An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request message. Upon receiving the request, the server sends back a status line, such as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK", and a message of its own. The body of this message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned</p>
        <br>
        <a name ="HTTP protocol"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">HTTP protocol</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style ="font-size: 20px;">HTTP is an application used as the fundamental foundation of communication on the web. HTTP is the first letter you type in when inputting a web address. HTTP is a request - response protocol. The client might request something and the http allows the client to access the information. Like when we updated our virtual machines the request we wanted was to go get updates for the software and http request went out and got updates. If you were on a bank website or the wikibook site it would be https the ‘s’ meaning secure. That means that the computer is communicating on a secure network.</p>

        <a name ="Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">CSS is a style sheet language standard set by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) used to create and edit the visual presentation of web pages. CSS allows web developers to isolate a web page's content and visual styles into separate documents and gives better page layout control. An external CSS sheet is generally linked to HTML and XHTML, it also can be linked to XML, SVG, and XUL. HTML and Javascript, with CSS, is a vital part of technology used by the majority of interfaces for websites. This is also used in interfaces for mobile devices making the websites more engaging.</p>

        <a name = "Types of CSS"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Types of CSS</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">CSS can be incorporated with HTML in 3 different ways; Inline, Internal, and External.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Inline styles add style to a single element on the page by placing 'style' after the element you wish to be styled.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Ex: h2 style = "color: blue"</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Internal styles create a style for a single document because the CSS is stored in the head of the HTML document. Internal styles are placed using a style tag around all style selectors.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">External style sheets exist in separate documents from HTML documents, allowing for better organization of style and structure. An external style sheet can be linked to all HTML documents making up a web site, allowing a web developer to style the entire site (all pages) using one document.</p>
        <br>
        <a name ="Web Design Programs"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Web Design Programs</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Web Design Programs help the webpage creator manage and create the content of a website. Many Web Design programs have many built in tools that ease the process of creating a website. Such programs are Dreamweaver and Sublime. There are also publishing programs like Wordpress and Ghost that allow the user to have more of a GUI based interface for blogging and managing a website.</p>
        <h3>sublime</h3>
        <P style="font-size: 20px;">Sublime is a text editor that allows the web developers, programmers, software engineers, etc. manipulate code. It's not only for HTML and CSS it can be set-up for many different programming languages and new productivity tools. One contribution that Sublime has that many do not is the "Package Control" Tool. The tool gives you full access to an entire library of content to better your coding experience. For example, there is a package you can install called Emmet, helping in typing massive amount of HTML, if you type "html:5" and press "tab" then emmet will push out all the correct syntax for an HTML 5 document.</P>
        <h3>SASS</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">SASS is some what like emmet but is more of a language. It is a Ruby engraved language that gives CSS much more capabilities like variables and nesting. Like emmet it makes writing CSS much faster and more efficient saving the programmer lots of time.</p>

        <h3>Client-Side Scripting</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Generally refers to computer programs on the web that are executed by the user's web browser, instead of on a web server, enabling web pages to be scripted. Client-side scripts do not require additional software on the server but instead utilize the user's web browser to understand the scripting language in which it is written.</p>
        <h3>Server-Side Scripting</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development that involves using scripts on a web server which produce a unique response for each user's request to the website.</p>
        <h3>Combination technologies</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">When both client side and server side scripting collectively build a webpage it is known as a web application. This web application can manage user interaction, security, and help improve performance between the client and server. Web applications can include anything from online stores to instant messaging services as long as both server and client sides execute scripts to a achieve a common goal in unison.</p>
        <br>
        <a name ="JavaScript"></a>
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">JavaScript</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style ="font-size:20px;">JavaScript is a scripting language that is used along with HTML and CSS as the three core components of the World Wide Web. JavaScript has first-class functions and is used in most websites. JavaScript does not have any I/O which means that it has to be embedded in the host environment. JavaScript is also used in PDF documents, game development, and desktop and mobile applications. JavaScript is most commonly used to make DHTML by adding client-side behavior to HTML pages.</p>

        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Worldwide Web Consortium</h2>
        <hr>
        <p style ="font-size:20px;">Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community of web members to meet the Web standards. It was founded by Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the Web, back in the 20th century. W3C is designed to reach a full potential of the Web and to make it accessible to all users from all over the world. Also, another aim for W3C was to make standards to maintain the growth of the Web in a single direction rather than splitting into competing groups. Here are some of the standards for W3C:
